# Python_path_finding_tkinter
Here, the program reads a text file and creates a 2D maze. The user inputs the starting and ending points, and then the program will find the shortest path between them using the chosen search algorithm and animate that algorithm on that maze as it searches for the end node. After the searching nodes reach the end node, the shortest path is shown.
